Week 8 PHP Forms and Web Interaction
------------------------------------

HTML Forms
----------

- when parameters are sent through url, can be accessed
by global super array "_GET"

e.g. http://.....com/index.html?x=5

can access x in above url in PHP using _GET

Forms - User Input / Action
---------------------------

- contains set of fields with keys, user fills in form fields
and submits with submit button, submitting key/value pairs from form as part of http request

e.g.

<form>
	<p><laber for="guess">Input Guess</label>
	<input type="text" name="guess" id="guess"></p>
	<input type="submit">
</form>

using GET and POST with forms
-----------------------------

- another global super array _POST can be used to access data from
POST request

<form method="post"> ---> sends form as post request

GET - Parameters are placed on URL which is retrieved
POST - URL is retrieved and parameters are appended to request in the HTTP connection

Passing Parameters to the Server
--------------------------------

Browser ----[HTTP Request]----> Web Server

GET /form1.php?guess=42
Accept : text/html
User-Agent: Lynx/2.4 libwww/2.14

POST /form3.php
Accept: text/html
User-agent: Lynx/2.4 libwww/2.14
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 13

guess=42

- in POST request, parameters are part of connection, not url

rules of POST/GET choice
------------------------

- POST is used when data is being created or modified
- GET is used when you are reading or searching things

e.g.

GET ---> searching for part by part ID on car website
(want parameters in URL so you can bookmark page of certain part and always go there)

POST ---> withdrawing 100 dollars using online banking
(DON'T want parameters in URL or else will withdraw 100 dollars every time you go to url including parameters in string)

- web search spdiers will follow GET URLs but generally not POST URLs

- GET URLs should be idempotent, same URL should give "same thing" each time you access it

- GET has an upper limit of number of bytes of parameters and values (think about 2k)

HTML Input Types
----------------

- SELECT tag, allows for form field where user can select from an assortment of dropdown OPTION tags

- input type="radio" radio buttons, can give multiple radio buttons same name, and when user selects one, deselects all others

- input type="checkbox", checkbox form field

- textarea form field, takes "rows" and "cols" fields and is a text box which is submitted as string to server
