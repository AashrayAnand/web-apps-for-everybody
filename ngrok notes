ngrok notes
-----------


- ngrok is a service which can be used to provide controlled access to localhost for specific channels (e.g. allow autograder to access website hosted through localhost, instead of being blocked by firewall)

steps:

1. download ngrok (https://ngrok.com/download)
2. move ngrok to some working directory (e.g desktop
3. execute following commands to start up ngrok:

	cd <directory where ngrok is>
	ngrok http 80
will result in output such as below:

note temporary url (https://05715239.ngrok.io as seen above)

4. check localhost to see PHP application is running (make sure MAMP is up)
5. construct ngrok url by replacing "http://localhost" with ngrok url

e.g.

http://localhost/assignment%204/ ---> https://05715239.ngrok.io/assignment%204/
